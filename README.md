# ðŸ˜ˆ Phishing Awareness Training Program

The Phishing Awareness Training Program is an educational initiative designed to teach students about the operational principles of phishing and how to protect themselves from phishing attacks. This program includes a phishing site simulation and interactive lessons, helping users understand how phishing attacks work in a real-world context. The training program aims to raise awareness among middle and high school students about cybersecurity threats and best practices for online safety.

## Features

- Phishing Simulation: A web-based simulation using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP that mimics real phishing attacks by capturing user input to demonstrate how personal data can be compromised.
- User Interface: A clear and interactive front-end designed to engage students and enhance their learning experience.
- Security Education: The program provides in-depth lessons on phishing, how to recognize phishing emails and websites, and steps to protect personal information.
- Training Sessions: Hands-on training sessions where students are guided through the simulation and educated on the dangers of phishing attacks and cybersecurity measures.

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript: For building the phishing simulation's front-end interface.
- PHP: For simulating the phishing system and capturing data input.
- MS PowerPoint: Includes an information slideshow that outlines the principles of phishing, along with protective measures.

## How It Works
1. Phishing Site Simulation: Students interact with a simulated phishing site that captures their login details to demonstrate how attackers collect personal information.
2. Security Training: After the simulation, students are guided through the process of identifying phishing attacks and learn various methods to protect their data online.
3. Interactive Feedback: The program provides real-time feedback during the simulation to help students recognize phishing elements.

## Future Plans
- Expand the phishing simulation to include various social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram.
- Adapt the program for in-person and remote learning environments to reach a broader audience.
- Collaborate with cybersecurity experts to enhance the training content.
